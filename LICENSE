The demos in this library are licensed separately.

The main reason for separate licenses is that the knockout demo uses glpk.js
(https://github.com/hgourvest/glpk.js) for linear programming in the browser.
glpk.js is licensed under GPL v2, so the knockout demo must also use the GPL
license. However, the rest of the demos are available under the MIT license
(like the main Escher project).
